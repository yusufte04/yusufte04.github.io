    I have always loved to make things and I always loved Technology. I started
    watching tech youtubers ever since I got my first gadget, my ipod touch. I
    would want to make things but it was impractical. I started messing with old
    laptops we had and I managed to download windows on a computer for the first
    time. It felt amazing bringing it back to life. This wasn't however, what I
    wanted to do. When I tried programing at first I found myself spending crazy
    hours on it without relaizing. I this is my way of making things and making
    my ideas come to life. I hope to have a future in this.
