    I always wanted to code something. I did not like the type of
    coding we did in class which is stuff like <a href="http://code.org">
    code.org</a>. I thought it was too easy and it got boring. i started
    messing with pyhton Then I started watching <a href="http://youtube.com">
   Youtube</a> videos about how to program and even sometimes how to hack and
   in late 2017 I heard about the one million arab coders program and I enroled
   I got accepted in the program and I did the android path. I made a few apps
   but, unfortunately I was not selected as top 100.I now know udacity so
   afterthat, I did some quick free courses then I enroled in the introduction
   to programing nanodegree since  I did not know what to do next.
