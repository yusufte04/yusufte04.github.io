      <h2>The Web </h2>
      <div class="text">
      <p> The Web is an accumulation of servers that comunicate. when somebody
opens a program and sorts a connection, the PC asks for the html in the
form of a http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).the moment  the server
gets the request it searches for the right html document and sends it
back to the PC to open and display html document.
      </p>
    </div>
      <h2>html (Hypertext Markup Language) </h2>
      <p> html makes up most of the web. html contains text content which is
        just plaintext and its the text you see and the markup which tells the
        computer what it looks
        like.html can also have refernce to other files (videos and images)
        and links to other pages.
      </p>
      <h2>html Tags and Elements</h2>
      <p>
        html elements are part of the markup. element are what tell the computer
        what text apears bold and what text apears italic etc. element Tags are
        structred all in a specific way. link with list of html elements and
        what they do :
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">LINK</a>
      </p>
      <h2> Computers are Stupid</h2>
        <p> Computers are stupid because they do exactly what you tell them so
          if a programer makes a small mistake it could cause a big issue and
          the computer could stop.
        </p>
        <h2>Inline and Block Elements</h2>
        <p> This is a <a href=
"https://www.w3resource.com/html/HTML-block-level-and-inline-elements.php">

a container around the content. Block elements are important for styling and
placing things around
